//! The integrated versioned workspace: branches, content, working sets,
//! and merge composed into the user-facing VCS operations
//! (spec/versioned-workspace-research-note.md §4–§7; untie-substrate
//! readiness tracker Phases 1–2; `whip branch` is the CLI surface).
//!
//! `WorkspaceVcs` is the mediator's storage half: every verb is a
//! proposal over immutable content — a write mints a new cut, a merge
//! either adopts certified content or returns structured conflicts and
//! moves NOTHING, a discard closes a head without deleting history. No
//! destructive verb exists on this surface. Manifests are stored as
//! content-addressed JSON blobs; a branch row carries only pointers, so
//! branch creation stays O(1) and a hundred branches share every
//! unchanged blob.
//!
//! Merging runs the P1 pipeline end to end: rebase-down first when the
//! parent moved (silent when slice-disjoint, honest structured conflicts
//! when not — never a fake auto-merge), then the staleness-checked
//! merge-up that adopts the branch and advances the parent head. The CLI
//! process is the single writer per workspace (the mediator); optimistic
//! head guards make a racing writer a refused normal outcome rather
//! than a lost update.
