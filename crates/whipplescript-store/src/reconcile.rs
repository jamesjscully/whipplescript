//! Reconciliation planner: the decision core of daemon v1
//! (spec/versioned-workspace-research-note.md §7.1; untie-substrate
//! readiness tracker Phase 1; lifecycle modeled in
//! ReconciliationDaemonLifecycle.tla, merge content in merge-slice /
//! merge-confluence.maude).
//!
//! Pure planning over manifests — no store handle, no feature gate. The
//! daemon loop (lease acquisition, head advancement, notification
//! delivery) executes these plans against the branch/workstream stores;
//! this module decides, the caller acts, and every refusal is a normal
//! outcome. The two directions carry different policies:
//!
//! * **Rebase-down** — "your nose is your branch's slice": a target delta
//!   that merges cleanly against the branch's divergence folds in
//!   silently AT ANY TIME, running included; a conflicting delta never
//!   touches a mid-run branch (per-run snapshot isolation is absolute)
//!   and surfaces at a quiescence point as the notification-and-ask
//!   payload — structured conflicts, both sides, provenance.
//! * **Merge-up** — only under the adoption lease, only quiescent, and
//!   only with the staleness bound discharged AT MERGE TIME: the branch
//!   must be fully rebased down (its branch point = the target's current
//!   head cut), so the certified content IS the branch head manifest and
//!   the advance is conflict-free by construction.
//!
//! v1 certificates are blob-plane (clean three-way = certificate); the
//! declaration-granularity slice certificate joins here when the
//! whip-source merge half lands.
