//! Sans-IO effect vocabulary (DR-0033, Decisions 1–3).
//!
//! An external-I/O effect is a **pure, resumable step machine**: `step` runs
//! synchronously on every host and returns either [`Outcome::NeedsIo`] (the host
//! must perform some I/O and re-enter with the result) or [`Outcome::Settle`]
//! (the machine is done). The *host* drives it — the native host runs it to
//! completion in one synchronous pass ([`run_to_completion`], `ureq`); the
//! durable-object host (Phase 5) awaits `fetch` on `NeedsIo` and re-enters
//! `step` across isolate wakes.
//!
//! This module is the neutral home for the transport-agnostic HTTP types and the
//! host/step contracts, so effects other than coerce (agent turns, later file
//! effects) reuse them without depending on coerce-specific code. The lifecycle
//! these types obey is proven in `models/tla/ResumableEffectLifecycle.tla`; the
//! native `run_to_completion` path is that model's eviction-free refinement
//! (`NativeExactlyOnce`).
