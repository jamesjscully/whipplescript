//! The instance-level sans-IO scheduler (DR-0033 chunk 4).
//!
//! This is the top-level machine the whole lift exists to enable: a workflow
//! instance driven as a resumable [`StepMachine`]. Its control flow is the native
//! `dev`-loop fixpoint, re-expressed so that when a ready effect needs the network
//! it suspends with [`Outcome::NeedsIo`] and the host re-enters `step` with the
//! response — the native host runs it straight through, the durable-object host
//! awaits `fetch` across isolate wakes.
//!
//! The fixpoint (proven in `models/tla/InstanceSchedulerLifecycle.tla`):
//!
//! ```text
//! loop:
//!   advance the rule pass to quiescence
//!     -> terminal?  Settle(Terminal)        (absorbing: no more rules/effects)
//!   next ready effect?
//!     -> none:      Settle(Parked)          (genuine fixpoint: nothing to do)
//!     -> some e:    run e
//!         -> Done:      loop                (store-only effect settled synchronously)
//!         -> NeedsHttp: NeedsIo(Http), remember e; resume it on the next step
//! ```
//!
//! The two host-varying pieces — the rule pass and effect execution — sit behind
//! [`InstanceDriver`]: the native binding wires `advance_rules` to
//! `rule_pass::step_instance_generic` and `run_effect` to the effect handlers; the
//! DO binding wires the same seams over its `DoSqliteStore` + `fetch`. Keeping the
//! scheduler control flow behind that seam is what makes the invariants above
//! unit-testable in the kernel (below) independent of any store or transport.
