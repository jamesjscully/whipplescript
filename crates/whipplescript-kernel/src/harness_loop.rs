//! Owned brokered agent harness: the pure tool-use loop driver.
//!
//! Slice 1 of DR-0024 (see spec/owned-harness-loop-contract.md). This module is
//! the network-free, store-free *spine* of the brokered turn: it drives a model
//! through a tool-use loop where the KERNEL executes each requested tool (I1,
//! brokering) rather than delegating the whole turn to a provider harness.
//!
//! Two side effects are factored behind traits so this stays unit-testable:
//!   - [`HarnessModelClient`] makes one model call (the CLI supplies a real
//!     `ureq`-backed provider client; tests inject a fake).
//!   - [`ToolExecutor`] runs one tool request against the workspace (the CLI
//!     supplies the file-store-bounded executor; tests inject a fake).
//!
//! The driver returns a [`BrokeredTurnOutcome`] whose `observations` are the
//! in-turn stream events. Per the DR-0024 boundary corollary they are
//! evidence-grade only: the kernel runner records them as evidence and never
//! derives a rule-matchable fact from them (I2, leaf-ness). Only the single
//! terminal becomes a fact (layer 3).
