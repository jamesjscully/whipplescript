Discriminated-family narrowing — the static soundness of branch-local `case`.

Companion to models/maude/case-family.maude. The Maude model bites the checker on
concrete bad programs; this module machine-checks the underlying type-theoretic
claims (per spec/decision-records/discriminated-families-design.md section 6.1):

  (a) per-arm scope judgment: the binding matched in arm `t` has exactly tag `t`'s
      payload type;
  (b) non-interference: that binding is out of scope in any other arm — a cross-arm
      payload read evaluates to `none`, a same-arm read yields the value;
  (c) a field read is typed against the MATCHED tag's payload (so a field of another
      variant cannot be applied);
  (d) exhaustiveness ⇒ totality: every declared tag is handled by its own arm or the
      wildcard — the static half of Total Outcome Settlement.

Non-dependent: finite tags + a flat payload-type per tag. No Mathlib.

    per tag. (A payload is a flat record type, never another family — exhaustiveness
    stays decidable over a finite tag set.) -/

/-- A guarded read of tag `u`'s payload from inside arm `t`: defined only when the
    tags coincide (you are in arm `u`), `none` otherwise. This is the elimination
    discipline — a payload field is reachable only within its own arm. -/

/-- (b) Non-interference, cross-arm: reading another arm's payload yields `none`.
    The binding from arm `t` is not in scope at a use site tagged `u ≠ t`. -/

/-- Coverage of a `case`: which tags have an unguarded arm, and whether a wildcard
    arm is present. A guarded arm never sets `covered` (it may fail at runtime), so
    coverage counts only unguarded arms — matching case-family.maude. -/

def Total (fam : Family Tag) (c : Coverage Tag) : Prop :=
  ∀ t, t ∈ fam.tags → (c.covered t = true ∨ c.wild = true)

/-- (d) THE GUARANTEE: exhaustiveness implies totality. Every outcome of the case is
    handled, so no tag can fall through unhandled — the static half of Total Outcome
    Settlement (the runtime half is auto-fail; see flow-autofail.maude). -/

/-- Conversely, a non-exhaustive case (no wildcard, a declared tag uncovered) is not
    total — there is an unhandled outcome. This is the rejected program: the `case`
    that case-family.maude flags `rejectNonExhaustive`. -/
