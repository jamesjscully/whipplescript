# Maude Models

Maude is the primary executable-spec target for the WhippleScript kernel and
for the package/library lowering pipeline.

Use it to model:

```text
rule commits
guard/readiness evaluation
workflow assertions
effect nodes
effect dependency edges
tracker-claim gated agent turns
completion/failure outcomes
library declaration acceptance
construct graph composition
lowering-class lifecycle contracts
lowering preservation into core IR
runtime handoff boundaries
bounded searches for bad rule cycles
```

The reusable kernel model lives at:

```sh
models/maude/kernel.maude
```

Hand-written executable checks live under:

```sh
models/maude/tests/
```

Run all Maude checks:

```sh
scripts/check-formal-models.sh
```

The newer package/lowering models layer on top of the reusable kernel:

```text
kernel.maude                   core runtime/event/effect/fact semantics
package-contract.maude         locked package/library contract registry and
                                typed provider-output boundary
construct-grammar.maude         controlled construct vocabulary, fixed
                                package construct grammar, and runtime provider
                                authorization boundary
construct-graph.maude           resource-qualified interface graph acceptance
construct-lowering.maude        accepted graph to ordinary core IR preservation
lowering-runtime-handoff.maude  lowered core IR entry into runtime shapes
lowering-class-lifecycle.maude  platform-owned lowering-class profiles
```

Current test suites:

```text
coerce-branches.maude            schema-coercion success/failure branches
package-contract.maude           locked package/library registry and
                                 typed-output boundary
construct-grammar.maude          construct acceptance, resource-qualified
                                 interface composition, capability_call
                                 lowering, event-source discipline, provider
                                 authorization boundary
construct-graph.maude            normalized construct graph acceptance
                                 invariants: edge compatibility, capability
                                 closure, port cardinality, unique-resolution
                                 witnesses, deterministic lowering output,
                                 compositionality,
                                 produced-port constraints, fact consistency,
                                 accepted-program adequacy
construct-interop-examples.maude abstract package-interop scenarios for the
                                 seven workflows in
                                 spec/construct-interop-examples.md
construct-lowering.maude         accepted-program to core-IR preservation:
                                 platform lowering, edge relation preservation,
                                 lowering-class lifecycle acceptance,
                                 deterministic reports, exactly-one core object
                                 ownership across node/edge entries, no extra
                                 capabilities, runtime inputs, package
                                 schedulers, or package lifecycle semantics
lowering-runtime-handoff.maude   lowered core IR entry into existing runtime
                                 lifecycle shapes: effect graph templates,
                                 dependency blocking, event/projection
                                 records, event-source/schedule templates, and
                                 rejection of lowered run, claim, terminal,
                                 cancellation, retry/lease, or provider-run
                                 state
lowering-class-lifecycle.maude   platform lowering-class lifecycle profiles:
                                 metadata, capability/typed/resource effects,
                                 event emit/source, projection view, schedule
                                 emitter, template vs event-record output,
                                 allowed object-entrypoint pairs, and forbidden
                                 hidden lifecycle authority
effect-dependencies.maude        success/failure/completes dependency release
guard-commit-bite.maude          bite proof: the generated no-commit search shape
                                 stays sound on the correct kernel yet catches an
                                 unsafe guard/assertion commit rewrite
expression-kernel.maude          guards, assertions, optional reads,
                                 AgentRef targets
native-provider-lifecycle.maude  cancellation ack, terminal evidence recovery,
                                 artifact failure, and duplicate-terminal
                                 safety
policy-capacity-retry.maude      policy/capacity blocks, lease expiry, retry
tracker-claim-turn.maude         tracker-claim gated coding-agent turn lifecycle
external-event-loop.maude        external-event-bounded agent loop
workflow-composition.maude       pattern elaboration, workflow completion,
                                 invocation
pattern-recursion.maude          pattern-application reachability: recursive
                                 apply rejection (graph.unbounded_pattern_recursion)
                                 with non-recursive nesting not flagged
flow-namespace.maude             flow-state ownership: a user rule accessing a
                                 FlowAwait_* fact is a violation; generated flow
                                 rules are exempt; non-owned facts are fine
flow-liveness.maude              flow branch-completeness: in a self-terminating
                                 flow a stalling branch is a violation; non-self-
                                 terminating flows and all-settling flows are fine
flow-autofail.maude              flow unhandled-failure auto-fail (503): in a self-
                                 terminating flow an unhandled effect failure auto-
                                 fails the workflow; handled failures and non-self-
                                 terminating flows never auto-fail
std-construct-authorization.maude  std-library construct lock exemption (1929 opt A):
                                 a built-in std construct use compiles without a
                                 package lock; third-party/unknown construct uses
                                 still require an authorizing lock
turn-access-grant.maude          turn-access grant authority narrowing (Proposal A):
                                 effective authority = profile intersect grant; a
                                 grant never widens beyond the profile
action-expansion.maude           action-call inlining (DR-0023): hygienic
                                 binding per call site, acyclic gate, and that
                                 inlining runs no provider work
workflow-revision.maude          active revision, old-effect attribution, and
                                 cancellation policy behavior
workflow-scoping.maude           workflow-local name scoping: a reference resolves
                                 against globals + its own workflow's locals, a
                                 sibling-only local name leaks, and a headerless
                                 program (no explicit workflow) is rejected
terminal-payload-shape.maude     workflow terminal payload shape: a class contract
                                 takes a field block, a scalar contract takes a
                                 matching scalar value; shape/type mismatches are
                                 rejected, correct shapes never wrongly rejected
invoke-result-typing.maude       typed invoke results: `after child succeeds as r`
                                 binds r to the child's OUTPUT contract (field
                                 access checked against it), `after child fails as
                                 f` to the failure base — predicate discrimination
```

The shell script runs every Maude test file and checks the expected number of
`No solution.` and `Solution 1` results for each suite. It also generates the
current `whip package catalog`, converts each catalog lowering into bounded
lifecycle obligations, and verifies the platform lowering classes satisfy
`lowering-class-lifecycle.maude` static-safety and authority-profile rules. That
catalog check does not prove emitted core-object outputs; output compatibility
is checked later from concrete lowered IR inventory. The script then generates a
package check report for `examples/packages/memory.json`, converts the emitted
`package_contract` artifact into bounded Maude obligations, and verifies package
effect-contract acceptance plus executable capability-call declaration lowering
against `package-contract.maude`. It also converts the same package contract's
construct registry into bounded construct-grammar obligations, proving the
package-declared capability-call construct is accepted by
`construct-grammar.maude` and lowers to an ordinary core effect template.

The script then generates a package lock and check report for
`examples/package-memory.whip`, converts the emitted `construct_graph` artifact
into bounded Maude obligations, and verifies node acceptance, edge acceptance,
and graph aggregation against `construct-graph.maude`. The same check report's
`lowered_ir_report` is converted into bounded lowering obligations that verify
edge preservation, node lowering preservation, core-object coverage, graph
lowering boundary evidence, generated graph aggregation, and runtime lifecycle
handoff against `construct-lowering.maude` and
`lowering-runtime-handoff.maude`. The generated handoff check uses concrete
`runtime_entrypoint` values from the emitted report and validator-owned
graph-boundary facts for deterministic lowering, report completeness,
no-runtime-inputs, and individual no-lowered-runtime-state facts rather than
any aggregate runtime-lifecycle evidence shortcut. The
bridge mirrors the Rust lowered-IR validator's current supported object-kind
and runtime-entrypoint slice: schema-reserved future objects such as diagnostic
records must become explicitly supported before generated Maude handoff checks
accept them. This is intentionally simple: generated checks can later emit a
richer manifest, but the
current script already fails CI when an expected safety search starts finding a
path, a real emitted construct graph falls outside the modeled acceptance rules,
the emitted lowered report falls outside the modeled lowering-preservation
rules, or the emitted runtime entrypoints fail the modeled handoff rules.

## Expression Kernel Model

The Maude kernel includes the finite expression-kernel abstraction from
`spec/expression-kernel.md`. It adds guard and assertion semantics without
turning Maude into a JSON/string interpreter.

Target checks:

```text
false guard cannot fire a rule
error guard cannot commit facts/effects
true guard preserves existing effect dependency searches
assertion failure cannot mutate workflow state
optional missing path cannot be read without a presence proof
enum/literal guards cannot match values outside their domain
dynamic tell cannot target an undeclared agent
```

Recommended shape:

```text
fact(F) + guard(R, F, true)  -> ruleReady(R, F, G)
fact(F) + guard(R, F, false) -> no rewrite
fact(F) + guard(R, F, error) -> diagnostic, no graph
```
