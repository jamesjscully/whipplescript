---- MODULE ControlPlaneLifecycle ----
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets

\* This model captures the durable control-plane lifecycle independently of
\* any particular WhippleScript source program. Maude models local rule/effect
\* rewrites; this TLA+ model tracks asynchronous runtime actions, leases,
\* recovery, pause/resume, cancellation, and event-log ordering.

\* Worker-time provider-binding failure (missing config/credentials/enforcement/
\* healthy binding): a claimed effect parks back to a non-terminal `blocked`
\* state BEFORE provider execution, releasing its run and lease. Recoverable, not
\* terminal (DR-0020). The categorized reason is a runtime field abstracted away
\* here; the lifecycle guarantee is that this never fabricates a terminal outcome.

\* A binding-blocked effect is recoverable, never terminal (DR-0020). A
\* misspecified BindBlock that fabricated a terminal outcome would violate this
\* together with TerminalEffectSetMatchesCurrentStatus.
BlockedEffectIsNotTerminal ==
  \A e \in Effects : effects[e] = "blocked" => e \notin terminalEffects

\* A blocked effect holds no live run or active lease: BindBlock released them, so
\* the effect can be re-claimed once UnblockEffect requeues it.
BlockedEffectHasNoLiveRun ==
  \A r \in Runs :
    effects[runEffect[r]] = "blocked" =>
      /\ runs[r] \notin {"claimed", "running"}
      /\ leases[r] # "active"

NoRunningRunWithoutActiveLease ==
  \A r \in Runs :
    runs[r] = "running" => /\ leases[r] = "active"
                            /\ effects[runEffect[r]] = "running"

NoTerminalRunHasActiveLease ==
  \A r \in Runs :
    runs[r] \in {"completed", "failed", "timed_out", "cancelled", "lease_expired", "uncertain"}
      => leases[r] # "active"

NoReleasedLeaseWithoutTerminalRun ==
  \A r \in Runs :
    leases[r] = "released" => runs[r] \in {"completed", "failed", "timed_out", "cancelled", "uncertain"}

\* Concurrent-worker safety: at most one run is executing (claimed/running) a
\* given effect at any instant. A whip worker may execute the ready set of
\* effects concurrently (a bounded thread pool), and several worker processes may
\* run against one instance; this invariant is the guarantee that lets that be
\* safe -- no external effect is ever executed by two runs at once. It holds
\* because `Claimable(e)` requires `effects[e] = "queued"` and `ClaimEffect`
\* flips the effect to "claimed", so a second concurrent claim for the same
\* effect cannot fire. (Bite: drop the `effects[e] = "queued"` guard from
\* Claimable and Apalache reports this invariant violated.)
AtMostOneRunExecutingEffect ==
  \A e \in Effects :
    Cardinality({ r \in Runs : runEffect[r] = e /\ runs[r] \in {"claimed", "running"} }) <= 1

\* Admission/idempotency contract (admission-and-idempotency.md): exactly-once
\* external effect. A run that recorded a terminal -- including an `uncertain`
\* recovery resolution of a started-without-terminal run -- never reverts to an
\* executing status, so its external side effect is never silently re-executed.
\* A retry of the effect is a fresh run (ClaimEffect requires run status "none"),
\* not a re-run of the terminaled one. With NoDuplicateTerminalRunEvents this
\* gives: each started run resolves to exactly one terminal and runs at most once.
