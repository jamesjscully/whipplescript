# WhippleScript Author

Use this skill when authoring, reviewing, or operating `.whip` workflows.

WhippleScript is a small language for durable orchestration: rules match typed
facts/events and atomically commit new facts, terminal state, or durable
effects. Use it for work that must survive process restarts, wait for external
actors, branch on completed effects, or leave an auditable trace.

## When To Use WhippleScript

Reach for WhippleScript when the user asks to orchestrate work, or when you
identify work that would benefit from durable coordination:

- long-running workflows, services, scheduled jobs, timers, deadlines, or
  recurring checks;
- parallelizable work, batch processing, fan-out/fan-in, map/reduce-style
  review, or bounded-concurrency dispatch;
- durable state, resumability, audit trails, event logs, queues, backlogs,
  claim/finish/release ownership, or retry policy;
- coordination across agents, humans, tools, packages, scripts, providers, or
  child workflows;
- human approval gates, review queues, escalation, cancellation, timeouts, or
  failure handling;
- typed model decisions that should feed deterministic policy, such as
  classification, routing over declared values, or structured extraction;
- workflow revision, migration, repair, diagnostics, traces, evidence, or
  replayable acceptance checks.

Do not use WhippleScript for an ordinary one-shot answer, a local code edit, a
single shell command, a simple calculation, or a normal library/app feature
unless durable orchestration is part of the requested behavior.

## Navigation

Use progressive disclosure. Do not read every doc up front. Stay in this skill
unless you need exact syntax, a checked example, or runtime command detail.

- Install or first run: [`docs/quickstart.md`](../../docs/quickstart.md).
- First full tutorial: [`docs/tutorial.md`](../../docs/tutorial.md).
- Feature stability and deprecations:
  [`docs/current-state.md`](../../docs/current-state.md).
- Unclear concepts: [`docs/concepts.md`](../../docs/concepts.md).
- Choosing a pattern: [`docs/manual.md`](../../docs/manual.md).
- Exact syntax: [`docs/language-reference.md`](../../docs/language-reference.md).
- Checked examples: [`docs/examples.md`](../../docs/examples.md).
- CLI flags: [`docs/api-reference.md`](../../docs/api-reference.md).
- JSON shapes: [`docs/json-reference.md`](../../docs/json-reference.md).
- Diagnostics by code/category:

- Fixture/native providers and packages: [`docs/providers.md`](../../docs/providers.md).
- Command failed: [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](../../docs/troubleshooting.md).

Use `spec/` only for design records or implementation trackers. Do not make an
author read `spec/` to write a normal workflow.

## Mental Model

WhippleScript is a restricted event-sourced rule machine for durable
orchestration. Typed facts and events drive rules. Each rule commit atomically
records consumed facts, new facts, dependency edges, terminal state, or durable
effect requests. Workers execute effects later and record evidence.

- A workflow instance owns an event log, facts, effects, provider runs,
  evidence, and lifecycle state.
- Rules are deterministic policy: they match facts/events, evaluate pure
  guards, and atomically commit facts, consumed facts, effects, dependencies,
  or workflow terminals.
- Effects are durable requests. They do not run inline; workers execute them
  later through providers.
- Source order does not sequence effects. Use `after <effect> succeeds`,
  `after <effect> fails`, `after <effect> times out`, or
  `after <effect> completes`.
- Effect output is only in scope in the `after` branch that proves the
  terminal status.
- Provider failure is not workflow failure. Source rules decide whether to
  retry, release, escalate, ignore, `complete`, or `fail`.
- Keep routing in typed source data: agent declarations, enums, literal
  fields, and `AgentRef<...>`. Do not ask a model to choose the provider,
  route, or authority.
- Workflow revision is a control-plane operation. Workflows may produce a
  candidate patch artifact, but activation happens with `whip revise`.

## Authoring Loop

Default to the smallest workflow that exposes durable policy as facts, rules,
and effects.

1. Confirm WhippleScript is the right tool: use it for orchestration, not for
   a one-shot answer or ordinary code edit.
2. Name the workflow and terminal contracts.
3. Model durable state with classes/enums. Prefer literal status fields for
   small state machines.
4. Pick one shape:
   - default to `rule`s for independent reactions, fan-out, retries, and
     event-driven policy;
   - use `flow` only for one fixed sequence with shared bindings;
   - use `queue` only when external work items need claim/finish/release
     ownership;
   - use `invoke` only when a subtask needs its own lifecycle.
5. Declare agents with the narrowest useful `profile`, `capacity`, and
   `capabilities`.
6. Put every external action behind an effect: `tell`, `coerce`, `askHuman`,
   `call`, `exec`, `timer`, `queue.*`, or `invoke`.
7. Sequence effect outputs only with `after` blocks or flow step order.
8. Add terminal rules: `complete output { ... }` or `fail failure { ... }`.
   Tag truly perpetual workflows `@service`.
9. Add assertions for the intended final facts/effects.
10. Run the validation loop and fix source until it passes:

```sh
whip doctor
whip check workflow.whip
whip --json dev workflow.whip --provider fixture --until idle
whip --json trace <instance> --check
```

## Gotchas

Keep these in mind before writing source:

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Relying on source order for effect sequencing | Use `after` branches or a `flow`. |
| Reading effect output outside its terminal branch | Bind output in `after x succeeds as y`. |
| Treating `coerce` as a local function | Branch on the durable effect completion. |
| Letting a model choose provider, route, or authority | Use `AgentRef`, enums, literals, and source metadata. |
| Treating provider failure as workflow failure | Add rules that retry, escalate, release, or `fail`. |
| Importing a skill with `use` | Attach skills to agents/turns; `use` imports package/library surface. |
| Hiding orchestration in shell scripts | Express policy as facts, rules, and effects. |
| Reading the clock in a guard | Use `timeout`, `timer`, or a recorded fact. |
| Treating a lost queue claim as fatal | Branch on claim failure and wait for the next item. |
| Placing credentials in `.whip` source | Use provider config credential references. |
| Self-modifying a live instance from source | Propose a patch artifact and use `whip revise`. |

## Minimal Workflow

```whip
workflow MinimalNoop

output result StartupSeen

class StartupSeen {
  source string
  state "observed"
}

rule observe_start
  when started
=> {
  record StartupSeen {
    source "external.started"
    state "observed"
  }

  complete result {
    source "external.started"
    state "observed"
  }
}
```

Run it:

```sh
whip check examples/minimal-noop.whip
whip --json dev examples/minimal-noop.whip --provider fixture --until idle
```

Use this only as a syntax sanity check. For useful patterns, start with:

- [`examples/human-review.whip`](../../examples/human-review.whip) for inbox
  review.
- [`examples/triage-flow.whip`](../../examples/triage-flow.whip) for a fixed
  agent plus human sequence.
- [`examples/queue-worker-with-review.whip`](../../examples/queue-worker-with-review.whip)
  for a backlog, claim, agent turn, structured review, and release/finish.
- [`examples/scheduled-escalation.whip`](../../examples/scheduled-escalation.whip)
  for timers and cancellation.
- [`examples/revision-validation-approval.whip`](../../examples/revision-validation-approval.whip)
  for safe revision proposal.

## Canonical Patterns

Agent work with explicit sequencing:

```whip
agent worker {
  provider fixture
  profile "repo-writer"
  capacity 1
  capabilities ["agent.tell"]
}

rule implement
  when WorkItem as item where item.status == "queued"
  when worker is available
=> {
  tell worker requires ["agent.tell"] as turn """markdown
  Implement this work item:

  {{ item.title }}
  """

  after turn succeeds as completed {
    done item -> record WorkItem {
      id item.id
      title item.title
      status "done"
    }
  }

  after turn fails as failed {
    askHuman as escalation choices ["retry", "block"] """markdown
    The worker failed on {{ item.title }}:

    {{ failed.reason }}
    """
  }
}
```

Typed model decision:

```whip
coerce classifyRequest(title string, body string) -> RequestClassification {
  prompt """markdown
  Classify this work request.

  Title: {{ title }}
  Body: {{ body }}

  {{ ctx.output_format }}
  """
}

rule classify
  when WorkItem as item where item.status == "queued"
=> {
  coerce classifyRequest(item.title, item.body) as classification

  after classification succeeds as result {
    record ClassifiedWork {
      item item
      classification result
    }
  }

  after classification fails {
    askHuman "Classify manually: {{ item.title }}"
  }
}
```

Sequential flow:

```whip
flow triage_ticket
  when Ticket as ticket where ticket.status == "open"
  when triager is available
{
  tell triager as plan timeout 10m "Propose a fix plan for {{ ticket.title }}."
  on timeout { fail error { reason "triage timed out" } }

  askHuman as signoff choices ["approve", "reject"] "Approve {{ plan.summary }}?"

  when signoff.choice == "approve" {
    complete result { decision "approved" }
  } else {
    fail error { reason "rejected" }
  }
}
```

Queue work:

```whip
queue backlog {
  tracker builtin
}

rule work_ready_item
  when backlog has ready item as item
  when worker is available
=> {
  claim item as lease

  after lease succeeds {
    tell worker as turn "Resolve {{ item.title }}."
  }

  after turn succeeds as outcome {
    finish item { summary outcome.summary }
  }

  after turn fails {
    release item
  }
}
```

Package context with provenance:

```whip
use memory

rule recall_before_work
  when WorkItem as item where item.status == "queued"
=> {
  call memory.query for item as context

  after context succeeds as found {
    tell worker as turn "Use this context: {{ found.summary }}"
  }
}
```

Typed dynamic agent routing:

```whip
class ReviewTask {
  reviewer AgentRef<codex | claude | pi>
  title string
  trackerPath string
  status "queued"
}

rule dispatch_review
  when ReviewTask as task where task.status == "queued"
  when task.reviewer is available
=> {
  tell task.reviewer requires ["agent.tell"] as turn """markdown
  Review {{ task.title }} and update {{ task.trackerPath }}.

  The workflow selected the logical reviewer through typed AgentRef metadata.
  Do not infer provider, model, or route identity from prompt text.
  """
}
```

Use `AgentRef<...>` when workflow data selects a logical agent. The value is
source metadata, not a model decision. BAML/model output may review observed
provider evidence, but must not choose the provider or route.

## Revision Guidance

When a workflow needs to change itself or repair a running instance:

- produce a candidate `.whip` file, diff, or patch artifact through ordinary
  effects;
- record where the proposal lives and why it was produced;
- ask a human or operator workflow to approve the candidate when appropriate;
- instruct the operator to dry-run first.

```sh
whip revise <instance> candidate.whip --root Workflow --dry-run
whip revise <instance> candidate.whip --root Workflow --cancel keep
```

Do not write source that tries to call `revise` from a rule body.

## Debug Workflow

Use these commands before changing source or prompts:

```sh
whip doctor
whip check workflow.whip
whip --json dev workflow.whip --provider fixture --until idle
whip dev workflow.whip --provider fixture --until idle --stream ndjson
whip status <instance>
whip effects <instance>
whip runs <instance>
whip --json diagnostics <instance>
whip --json evidence <instance>
whip --json trace <instance> --check
```

If an effect did not run, inspect `effects` first. The status and
`policy_block_reason` normally say whether it is waiting on a dependency,
capacity, capability, profile, or terminal state.

## Safety

- Keep workflows small, explicit, and analyzable.
- Use the fixture provider before real providers.
- Use human review for destructive or ambiguous steps.
- Keep profiles narrow: `repo-reader`, `repo-writer`, `internet-research`,
  `human-review`, or package-specific authority.
- Query memory and package capabilities as explicit effects so provenance is
  recorded.
- Preserve evidence before repairing runtime state.
